Analyze the following image of an invoice and extract key details accurately.
Pay special attention to the table columns and ensure that the values match the correct fields.
Read both arabic and english data and compare between them to extract the most accurate data.


### Instructions for Table Extraction:
1. The table has specific columns with Arabic headers. These columns must be mapped as follows:
   - "رقم الصنف" = id (Item ID).
   - "اسم الصنف" = item_description_arabic (Arabic description).
   - Use any corresponding English description, if present, for item_description_english.
   - "الكمية" = quantity (Quantity of the item).
   - "السعر" = unit_price (Price per unit).
   - "المجموع" = total_price (Total price without tax).
   - "نسبة الضريبة" = tax_percentage_per_item (Tax percentage).
   - "المجموع الأساسي" = total_price_with_tax (Total price including tax).
2. Extract **only** the numeric value under "الكمية" for the **quantity** field. Do not confuse it with "المجموع" or other columns.
